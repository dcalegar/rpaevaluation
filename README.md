# RPA Tool Evaluation

This project is being developed as a final project for the Systems Engineering program at Universidad ORT Uruguay.

Its main objective is to adapt an evaluation methodology designed initially for Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) [CD18, DC17, DCMFG15] to the evaluation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools. This work contributes to the systematization of RPA tool evaluation and selection, facilitating informed decision-making.

This repository contains the working materials used throughout the project, as well as the templates that support the application of the proposed evaluation process.
