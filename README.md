# RPA Tool Evaluation

This project is being developed as a final project for the Systems Engineering program at Universidad ORT Uruguay.

Its main objective is to adapt an evaluation methodology designed initially for Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) to the evaluation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools. This work contributes to the systematization of RPA tool evaluation and selection, facilitating informed decision-making.

This repository contains the working materials used throughout the project, as well as the templates that support the application of the proposed evaluation process.
